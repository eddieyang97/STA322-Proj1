Topic: how much should Duke students who take course in natural science departments expect to spend on required textbooks if they buy them new at the Duke textbook store?

Questions: point estimate and 95% CI
1. What is the total cost of required books in the natural sciences at Duke?
2. What is the average number of required books per course in the natural sciences at Duke?
3. What is the average of the (total) cost of required books per course in the natural sciences at Duke?
